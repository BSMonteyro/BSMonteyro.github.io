<b> <p>Most recently over break I celebrated Thanksgiving at my uncle's
house. We had the traditional Thanksgiving food that everyone has as
well as some pies that were different combinations that ended up being
pretty good. </p>

 <p> I started a youtube channel with my friend Nick. We intend to do
 various things, but focus specifically on reviewing lacrosse gear,
 trying different viral challenges, and recording my process of learning
 and training in flips and parkour. </p>

<p> My first semester of college is coming to an end. It seems like I
just am finally settling in as a "college student." Finals are about two
weeks away and it seems as if classes are just starting. </p>
